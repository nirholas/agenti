## Tips & Tricks

### Go Slow to Avoid Rate Limits
X may limit your account if you do too many actions too fast. The scripts have built-in delays, but if you're unfollowing thousands of people:
- Run in batches
- Wait 15-30 minutes between runs

### Keep Your Browser Open
Don't close the x.com tab while operations are running.

### Dashboard Real-Time Monitoring
With the dashboard, you can watch operations happen in real-time. The admin can also monitor all sessions!
