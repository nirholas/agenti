</div>

## ⚡ Active Development

Lyra Intel is **actively being enhanced with improvements daily**. The core platform is production-ready and being used in enterprise deployments. Thank you for your contributions! 🙌

## Why Lyra Intel?

Most code analysis tools force a choice: **automation at the cost of understanding**, or **manual inspection with no scale**.

Lyra Intel is built on a different principle: **Give developers and security teams the intelligence they need to make informed decisions at scale.**

**You get:**
- ✅ **Complete visibility** - Understand your entire codebase, not just highlighted issues
- ✅ **AI-powered insights** - Get context and explanations, not just lists of problems
- ✅ **Security you control** - Run locally or in your cloud, with no data leaving your infrastructure
- ✅ **Scale without sacrifice** - Analyze 1 million lines or 1 billion lines with the same ease
- ✅ **Open source** - Full transparency, no vendor lock-in, customize for your needs

Perfect for teams that want to **own their code intelligence**.

## What is Lyra Intel?

Lyra Intel is a comprehensive, production-ready intelligence platform designed to **understand, secure, and improve codebases of any size** - from small projects to enterprise monorepos with millions of lines of code.

Unlike traditional linters or SonarQube-style tools, Lyra Intel combines:
- **Deep code analysis** (AST parsing, dependency graphs, complexity metrics)
- **AI-powered insights** (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models)
- **Semantic code search** (ML-powered search beyond keywords)
- **Security scanning** (secrets, OWASP, CVE detection)
- **Knowledge graphs** (understand relationships in your code)
- **Forensic analysis** (find dead code, document gaps, technical debt)

### Why You Need Lyra Intel

**For Security Teams:**
- Automatically find hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, OWASP vulnerabilities
- Track security across massive codebases without manual scanning
- Generate compliance reports (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS ready)

**For Development Teams:**
- Understand unfamiliar codebases in hours, not weeks
- Find dead code and technical debt before they become problems
- Make data-driven architectural decisions
- Detect complex bugs that static analysis misses

**For Engineering Leaders:**
- Quantify code quality and technical debt
- Track metrics across teams and projects
- Plan migrations and upgrades with confidence
- Reduce time spent on code reviews

## What You Can Do

With 70+ specialized components, Lyra Intel enables:

| Goal | What Lyra Intel Does | Time Saved |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Secure a legacy codebase** | Scan for vulnerabilities, create remediation plan | Weeks → Hours |
| **Onboard new developers** | Build searchable knowledge base, find examples | Days → Hours |
| **Plan a framework upgrade** | Analyze impact, generate step-by-step migration plan | Months → Days |
| **Understand technical debt** | Quantify debt, track trends, prioritize fixes | Ongoing → Automated |
| **Review pull requests** | AI-powered insights + security checks + complexity analysis | 30 min → 5 min |

## Processing Modes

### Local Mode
Best for development and small repositories:
```python
from src import LyraIntelEngine, EngineConfig, ProcessingMode

config = EngineConfig(mode=ProcessingMode.LOCAL, max_workers=8)
engine = LyraIntelEngine(config)
result = await engine.analyze_repository("/path/to/repo")
```

### Distributed Mode
For larger codebases with multiple workers:
```python
config = EngineConfig(
    mode=ProcessingMode.DISTRIBUTED,
    max_workers=50,
)
```

### Cloud Massive Mode
For enterprise-scale analysis:
```python
config = EngineConfig(
    mode=ProcessingMode.CLOUD_MASSIVE,
    cloud_provider="aws",
    cloud_region="us-east-1",
    max_cloud_workers=1000,
)
```

## Analysis Results

The engine produces comprehensive analysis including:

- **File metrics**: Total files, sizes, line counts by extension
- **Code structure**: Functions, classes, methods with complexity scores
- **Dependencies**: Import/export relationships, circular dependencies
- **Git history**: Commits, authors, change frequency
- **Patterns**: Code smells, anti-patterns, security issues

Results are stored in SQLite (or your configured backend) and can be exported as JSON.
